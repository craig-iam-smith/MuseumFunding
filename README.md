# Innovative Funding for Car Museum through NFT Collateralization

## Introduction:
A growing trend in automotive museums is the lack of revenue to keep the doors open. Classic cars are making their way to auction houses and into private collections in ever greater numbers. Many of these museums are waiting until the cash flow is so small, the only logical action is liquidating the entire collection.

## Project Description:
Letâ€™s make a way for the best museums to keep their cars and the doors of the museum open.  Many people want to be supportive and donate to great causes.  Let's tokenize the assets and use the value in DeFi, while also providing NFTs and benefits for holding the NFTs.
### NFT Collateralization of museum assets: 
1. Sell fractional ownership of iconic cars, revenue going to the museum to keep the car where it can be appreciated by all
2. Provide collectible ERC-721 NFTs for each purchase (varying rarity based on purchase amount).  
3. The funds collected will generate recurring revenue to the museum: example- ETH staking, earning interes on Aave
4. Museum that holds the actual vehicle now gets a revenue stream, while keeping the display (can provide perks for holders)
5. The holder of the NFTs has ownership of a percentage of the car.
6. These NFTs would represent ownership or rights to the cars, used for all things DeFi.
7. other ideas. collectible NFTs for iconic cars, owning one of these NFTs will provide the holder with special perks (test drive, track day...)

## Implementation notes:
ERC-1155 will be used to fractionalize the assets
ERC-721 will be the collectible provided with each purchase of the asset
1. Different rarities will be minted based on purchase amount
2. The ERC-721 may be able to be used at the museum location for special treatment

In order to make a liquid token for DeFi, make a pool to hold ERC-1155 tokens and issue ERC-20 tokens backed by the pool

### More verbiage
Fractionalize the cars (NFTs that tokenize the ownership) - 	Collectors can collect the classic cars of their dreams, the museum may sell fractions at a discount to the actual value of the asset, and automatically stake/invest/loan the value used to purchase the NFT to provide a long term revenue stream.  The holder of the NFT would have unlimited visits to the car museum, so they can see their baby.
The museum can sell fractions and keep the car in safekeeping, with proof of ownership by having it on display.  NFT holders themselves or curators could check in (QR code with pic of car) to provide proof of asset on location.
As long as the museum maintains ownership of the physical item, the NFT holder has a really cool NFT, and unlimited visits to see the real thing.
If the museum sells the car,  the NFT holders get paid out on their fraction of the car.  The sale must be provable as market value.  Either sold at a reputable auction appropriate to the asset or sold for a price comparable to recent verifiable sales.
 

Curators provide proof the physical RWA is still held by NFT issuer -

## Financial Plan:
Funding Needs: 
1) Code/Tech Development
2) Business Development
3) Marketing
4) Operational costs.
Revenue Model: 
1) Initial Sales: settable percentage from initial sales
2) Revenue Stream: settable percentage of investing income
3) Provide a method for depositing NFT into pool and issue fungible tokens.
Fractional Ownership: Explain how collectors can own fractions of cars through NFTs, sold at a discount, with the proceeds invested to provide long-term revenue.

## Benefits:
Innovation in Funding: Highlight how this method could revolutionize museum funding, making it more accessible and engaging for tech-savvy investors.
Engagement: Discuss how NFT ownership could increase visitor engagement through virtual reality experiences or exclusive access to events.
Preservation: Emphasize how funds will ensure better preservation and presentation of automotive history.

## Risk Management:
Market Volatility: Address the risks associated with cryptocurrency and NFT value fluctuations.
Regulatory Compliance: Mention steps to ensure compliance with current and future regulations regarding digital assets.

## Implementation Phases:
Phase 1: Collectible NFTs: Detail how the museum will create limited edition NFTs for iconic cars, providing special access to the car for NFT holders.
Phase 2: Fractional Ownership: Describe how the museum can fractionalize ownership through NFTs, allowing collectors to own parts of classic cars while the museum retains physical custody.

## Conclusion:
Call to Action: Encourage potential funders to see this as not just an investment but a contribution to cultural heritage. 
Future Vision: Paint a picture of how this project could set a precedent for other cultural institutions, using technology to fund preservation.

## Appendices:
Technical Specifications: Details on blockchain technology used, security measures for NFTs.
Case Studies: Examples from automotive or art industries where NFTs have been successfully implemented for similar purposes.

This integration not only provides a detailed roadmap for the project but also emphasizes the dual benefits of financial sustainability for the museum and unique ownership opportunities for collectors, aligning with the trend of preserving automotive history through innovative means.
