## Car Museum DAO
** Own a piece of history

- A growing trend in automotive museums is the lack of revenue to keep the doors open. Classic cars are making their way to auction houses and into private collections in ever greater numbers. Many of these museums are waiting until the cash flow is so small, the only logical action is liquidating the entire collection. 
- Letâ€™s make a way for the best museums to keep their cars and the doors of the museum open.
- To start make collectible NFTs (limited numbers) for iconic cars, owning one of these NFTs will provide the holder with special perks such as special access to the car.  The museum that holds the actual vehicle gets the revenue from the initial sale and royalties on subsequent sales.  While this can provide an initial revenue boost, automatically deploying the proceeds in to DeFi will provide a sustaining income stream.
- Next phase: Fractionalize the cars (NFTs that tokenize the ownership) - 	Collectors can collect the classic cars of their dreams, the museum may sell fractions at a discount to the actual value of the asset, and automatically stake/invest/loan the value used to purchase the NFT to provide a long term revenue stream.  The holder of the NFT would have unlimited visits to the car museum, so they can see their baby.
The museum can sell fractions and keep the car in safekeeping, with proof of ownership by having it on display.  NFT holders themselves or curators could check in (QR code with pic of car) to provide proof of asset on location.
As long as the museum maintains ownership of the physical item, the NFT holder has a really cool NFT, and unlimited visits to see the real thing.
If the museum sells the car,  the NFT holders get paid out on their fraction of the car.  The sale must be provable as market value.  Either sold at a reputable auction appropriate to the asset or sold for a price comparable to recent verifiable sales.
 

Curators provide proof the physical RWA is still held by NFT issuer -
